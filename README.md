# Custom Shell Project Summary

Developed a custom shell in Python, completing a total of 23 stages, which included handling core shell functionality. Implemented 7 builtins: 
- exit
- echo
- type
- pwd
- cd (handling absolute, relative, and home directory paths)
- Quoting mechanisms with single and double quotes, including special handling for backslashes.

The shell supports executing external programs by searching through directories in the PATH environment variable and correctly parsing and running commands with arguments. Ensured robust handling of file paths, navigation, and environment variable expansion, making this project a comprehensive exercise in system-level programming and shell behavior.

## Test Cases (Stages Completed):
1. Print a prompt
2. Handle invalid commands
3. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
4. The exit builtin
5. The echo builtin
6. The type builtin: builtins
7. The type builtin: executable files
8. Run a program
9. The pwd builtin
10. The cd builtin: Absolute paths
11. The cd builtin: Relative paths
12. The cd builtin: Home directory
13. Single quotes (Quoting)
14. Double quotes (Quoting)
15. Backslash outside quotes
16. Backslash within single quotes
17. Backslash within double quotes
18. Executing a quoted executable
19. cd with absolute path
20. cd with relative path
21. cd with home directory (~)
22. Quoting with single quotes
23. Quoting with double quotes
